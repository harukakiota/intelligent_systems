Can I Have a Word?
Can I have a word, please? 
It can be any word. 
Just give me a word. 

We can all share the rest. 
Just let me have one. 
It can be anything. 
I'd take canteen or avid. 
I'd even settle for timely. 

But you can't use my word, 
whatever it is, 
without asking. 
Because it's my word. 

And I'll almost always let you use it when you ask. 
Unless, for example, my word is wonderful 
and you want to use it to describe a movie I haven't seen yet 
or a movie I saw already and didn't care for. 

I really want everything. 
That's my first choice. 
Flabbergasted is a close second.
